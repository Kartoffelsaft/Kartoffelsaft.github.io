                I believe this project represents roughly when I actually
                started to take on programming as a hobby. There's a few things
                that I had made before this, of course, but usually those
                things either ran into difficulties that considerably
                discouraged me or were so small that it didn't really count.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a little while before this project I would search forums
                about how to learn programming. People would post questions
                like "What programming language should I start with?" and all
                the responses would say JavaScript or Python, with the caveat
                that they could maybe do C# or Java if they were <i>really</i>
                serious. Occasionally someone would say they wanted to start
                with C++, which would universally be met with "NO! DON'T DO
                THAT! ANYTHING BUT C++!"
            </p>
            <p>
                So, naturally, I avoided C++, because I was a "beginner".
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of my projects before this time (of which I have very few
                because I lost that data), I would come out of super frustrated
                and confused. The languages listed above all try to abstract
                things away, but those abstractions are unfortunately leaky so
                everything I made would become a buggy mess.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, after a lot of this frustration, I figured '****
                that advice, I'm learning C++ anyways', and followed whatever
                tutorial I found online (<a href='https://www.learncpp.com/'>
                This one </a> if you're curious. It's been updated quite a bit,
                so I don't know what it's like now, but at the time it was
                actually quite informative). Everything made so much more sense
                because the language never tried to abstract away what the
                computer was actually doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After doing enough of that tutorial to feel comfortable with
                C++, I made this little game.

                My idea was that it would be kind of like <i> Sid Meier's
                Civilization </i> but with an interface more like <i> Dwarf
                Fortress </i> to make the development easier. Of course, the
                game is largely incomplete and not very fun. The world gen
                is a bit more interesting though.
